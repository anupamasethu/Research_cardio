Medical research on cardiovascular illness is expanding, with computerized assessments of a patientâ€™s heart function available for more efficient therapy. Raised BP, obesity, smoking, cholesterol, and ancestral history are elements that increase the likelihood of developing heart disease. This project underlines the difficulties healthcare facilities face in offering excellent care at reasonable prices and stresses the need for timely diagnosis and efficient treatment. Used a database on heart disease that uses both numerical and categorical data. Several data mining techniques, such as AdaBoost, Random Forest, KNN classifier, NB, ANN, SVC, DT, Logistic Regression, and Catboost Classifier, are enlisted in the scrutinized to construct a comprehensive heart disease prediction model.
